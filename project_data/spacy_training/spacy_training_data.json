Collection + 17-Sep-2025 / 11:31 AM Age/Gender : 72Y /Male Received ! 17-Sep-2025 / 12:13 PM Collected At : Emami Frank Ross Limited Report : 17-Sep-2025 / 13:35 PM Referral Dr se Report Status : Final Print : Bed Biochemistry Investigation Observed Value Unit Biological Ref. Interval Specimen ELECTROLYTES SODIUM 121 mmol/L 136-145 Serum Method: Indirect ISE POTASSIUM 4.4 mmol/L 3.5-5.1 Serum Method: Indirect ISE CHLORIDE 84 mmol/L 98-107 Serum Method: Indirect ISE Remarks: The value should be read in conjunction with the clinical history, diet, supplements, medications, and other relevant parameters. Comments: Electrolytes are minerals that are found in body tissues and blood in the form of dissolved salts. Electrolyte levels are affected by diet, kidney status, body hydration, physical exercise, some hormones such as aldosterone (which conserves sodium and promotes the elimination of potassium) and natriuretic peptides (which increase elimination of sodium by the kidneys), diseased states such as diabetes, chronic kidney and lung disorders etc. Sodium\u2014most of the body's sodium is found in the fluid outside of the body's cells, where it helps to regulate the amount of water in the body. Potassium-this electrolyte is found mainly inside the body's cells. A small but vital amount of potassium is found in the plasma, the liquid portion of the blood. Potassium plays an important role in regulating muscle contraction. Monitoring potassium is important as small changes in the potassium level can affect the heart's rhythm and ability to contract. Chloride-this electrolyte moves in and out of the cells to help maintain electrical neutrality (concentrations of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions must be equal) and its level usually mirrors that of sodium. Due to its close association with sodium, chloride also helps to regulate the distribution of water in the body. aAly Verified By:222626 Jem \u00a9 Verified Date : 17-Sep-2025 /13:35 Dr. Ashwin Kumar AS MBBS, MD Consultant Biochemist --- End Of Report --- Important Instructions: *Test results released pertain to specimen submitted. *All results are dependent upon the quality of specimen received in the laboratory. *Lab investigation is only a tool to faciilitate in concluding a diagnosis , and should be clinically correlated by the referring physician. *Certain tests may require further testing, at an additional cost for derivation of excact value. kindly submit request with in 2 days, post reporting. *Sample repeats are accepted on request of Referring Physician with in sample stability period.

Comments: Electrolytes are minerals that are found in body tissues and blood in the form of dissolved salts. Electrolyte levels are affected by diet, kidney status, body hydration, physical exercise, some hormones such as aldosterone (which conserves sodium and promotes the elimination of potassium) and natriuretic peptides (which increase elimination of sodium by the kidneys), diseased states such as diabetes, chronic kidney and lung disorders etc. Sodium\u2014most of the body's sodium is found in the fluid outside of the body's cells, where it helps to regulate the amount of water in the body. Potassium-this electrolyte is found mainly inside the body's cells. A small but vital amount of potassium is found in the plasma, the liquid portion of the blood. Potassium plays an important role in regulating muscle contraction. Monitoring potassium is important as small changes in the potassium level can affect the heart's rhythm and ability to contract. Chloride-this electrolyte moves in and out of the cells to help maintain electrical neutrality (concentrations of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions must be equal) and its level usually mirrors that of sodium. Due to its close association with sodium, chloride also helps to regulate the distribution of water in the body. aAly Verified By:222626 Jem \u00a9 Verified Date : 17-Sep-2025 /13:35 Dr. Ashwin Kumar AS MBBS, MD Consultant Biochemist --- End Of Report --- Important Instructions: *Test results released pertain to specimen submitted. *All results are dependent upon the quality of specimen received in the laboratory. *Lab investigation is only a tool to faciilitate in concluding a diagnosis , and should be clinically correlated by the referring physician. *Certain tests may require further testing, at an additional cost for derivation of excact value. kindly submit request with in 2 days, post reporting. *Sample repeats are accepted on request of Referring Physician with in sample stability period.

Time:30-Jun-2025 16:14 Note: Active B12 test measures the amount of B12 bound to Holo Transcobalamin whereas the serum Vit B12 measure both Transcobalamin (TC) and Haptocorrin (HC) fractions as total Vit B12. It is more sensitive. If the serum vitamin B12 level is < 300 pg/mL, the levels of Active Vit B12 alone or in combination with serum total Vit B12 levels is/are useful in unmasking the deficiency state. Holo TC level of < 32 pmol/L indicates Vit B12 deficiency. Measurement of Active Vit B12 is found to be more sensitive in detecting Vit B12 deficiency. Holo Transcobalamin level of < 32 pmol/L has been suggested as cut off to identify the Vit B12 deficiency. Active Vitamin B12 levels will remain unchanged in pregnancy. High titres of Intrinsic factor blocking auto antibodies (IF Ab) can lead to spuriously normal or high Vitamin B12 values.
